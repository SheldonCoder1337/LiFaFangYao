At present, the treatment for breast cancer is a comprehensive treatment based on surgery, but many complications often occur after breast cancer surgery, among which, the upper limb lymphedema (BCRL) after breast cancer surgery is one of the common complications. BCRL can cause upper limb swelling, fatigue and pain, and even lead to upper limb dysfunction, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. Therefore, it is particularly important to reduce the degree of edema and improve the quality of life of patients. With the continuous exploration of BCRL treatment, the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine in treating this disease is outstanding. Among them, acupuncture and moxibustion therapy has shown a good effect in alleviating the swelling of the affected limb and reducing the arm circumference of the affected limb. However, the number of existing clinical studies is small, and most of them are small sample studies. The evidence coverage is insufficient, and there is no direct comparison between different acupuncture and moxibustion therapies.",
